# IconCreator
A no-bullshit icon creator for Microsoft Windows Vista and above. Select an source image on your harddrive, select included image sizes and create.

This program allows you to convert an image from your computer into a Windows .ICO file.
You can include various different sizes in the icon that are automatically created from
the source image.

The usage is very simple:

* Select a source file from the explorer by clicking the "..." button
* Select the icon sizes you wish to include in the icon container
* Click the Create button and select the output name and location

I made this tool for myself since I create icons using Inkscape which lacks the ICO export.
