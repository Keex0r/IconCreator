# NoBS Icon Creator
A no-bullshit icon creator for Microsoft Windows Vista and above. Select an source image on your harddrive, select included image sizes and create.

This program allows you to convert an image from your computer into a Windows .ICO file.
You can include various different sizes in the icon that are automatically created from
the source image.

The usage is very simple:

* Select a source file from the explorer by clicking the "..." button
* Select the icon sizes you wish to include in the icon container
* Click the Create button and select the output name and location

# Scope of the Software
I made this tool for myself since I create icons using Inkscape which lacks the ICO export.
Many tools costs money for good reason since they incorporate a lot more functionality. But
in most cases you create the actual graphics in some other software anyways and just want
to create the icon. Online converters exist which then again often don't allow the
incorporation of additional icon sizes.
This tool here aims at just providing the bare essential functions I (and maybe others) need,
in a convenient implementation.

# Requirements
The tool targets the .NET Framework 4.5.2 and therefore needs Windows Vista SP2 or above.
The created icons are also only compatible with Vista or above, due to the image data
being saved in PNG format in the containers.
